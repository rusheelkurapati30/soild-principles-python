The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable object-oriented software. They are:

	1.	Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
	2.	Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
	3.	Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
	4.	Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
	5.	Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Each principle focuses on a specific aspect of software design, aiming to make code easier to understand, modify, and extend. If youâ€™d like, I can provide more details about each principle.
